Project Theme:
We would like to explore the relationship between officer compliance with department medical
policy including but not limited to incidents of drug and alcohol abuse, with allegations of police
misconduct, officer salary and rank, use of force by police, location and type of police work
conducted, and distribution of awards given by the department. We will explore these
relationships with other aspects of health as the data allows for.

For our first checkpoint, we sought to perform relational analytics to establish a baseline for the prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse and medical allegations among officers in the CPD. Our queries were as follows: 1) What percentage of officers has at least one drug and alcohol abuse allegation?; 2) Are drug/alcohol abuse allegations more likely to be made against on or off duty officers?; 3) What percentage of officers are involved in medical policy violation allegations?; 4) Are there differences in officer salary and/or distribution of awards among police with and without drug/alcohol abuse allegations and other medical allegations? and 5) Among officers with drug/alcohol abuse allegations, what is the average amount of time they have been on the force?
